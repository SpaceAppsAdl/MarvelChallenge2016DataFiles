There are a large number of DAT files forming the collection of radargram files.

These are hosted at ftp://ftp.ira.inaf.it/pub/outgoing/rorosei/hackaton/ however this might become a slow link during the competition.

This repository contains a subset of the files from that location.

It is likely that to work on the challenge, you do not need to look at all of the possible data files.

Which means you can simply clone this repository instead.
